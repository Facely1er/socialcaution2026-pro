# Index Methodology — Data Sources

This document lists **all data sources and their URLs** used for the SocialCaution **Privacy Exposure Index** methodology: the Service Exposure Index (per-service score), the Digital Footprint Score, the Combined Privacy Exposure Index, and all supporting rating services.

---

## 0. Methodology Versioning & Source Freshness

| Field | Value |
|------|-------|
| Methodology version | **v2.5.0** |
| Released | **2026-02-26** |
| Last reviewed | **2026-02-26** |
| Scoring model | Unified **8-factor** model for all tiers (free UI = concise summary, premium UI = full detail) |
| Coverage scope | **201 enhanced services** |
| Breach factor data approach | Structured breach incidents with source URLs + keyword fallback when structured incidents are unavailable |

Primary source freshness registry is maintained in `src/config/methodologyMetadata.js`.

---

## 1. Primary Data Sources (Service Exposure Index)

The **Service Exposure Index** (0–100 per service) is calculated from the following three primary data sources. They are maintained in the codebase and updated from public information (see Section 3).

| # | Data source | Description | Implementation file(s) |
|---|-------------|-------------|------------------------|
| 1 | **Service catalog** | Service metadata and categorization (e.g., category, name, type, id). Used to identify services and their category for factor logic (e.g., data sensitivity, privacy-enhancing caps). | `src/data/serviceCatalog.js` |
| 2 | **Service risk profiles** | Per-service privacy risks, known issues, regulations, and recommended actions. Feeds: typical privacy risks (Factor 1), known issues (Factor 2), known breach history (Factor 3), regulatory oversight (Factor 4), user control (Factor 7), third-party data sharing (Factor 8). | `src/data/serviceRiskProfiles.js` |
| 3 | **Service relationships** | Parent company and sibling service relationships. Used for the **Parent Company & Siblings** factor (Factor 5). | `src/data/serviceRelationships.js` |

**Enhanced catalog (optional):**  
When available, **enhanced service data** (extra metadata) is used via `getAllEnhancedServices()` from `src/data/serviceCatalogEnhanced.js`, which builds on the base catalog and `serviceRelationships`. The enhanced catalog currently contains **201** services with detailed attributes including `privacy_policy_url`, `website`, `ios_app_url`, `android_app_url`, breach `source_url`s, encryption levels, data collection types, and more.

**Calculation:**  
The index is computed in `src/utils/privacyExposureIndex.js`, which imports the three primary sources above (and uses the enhanced catalog where applicable).

---

## 2. Data Sources for Combined Index & Digital Footprint

The **Combined Privacy Exposure Index** (0–100) combines:

- **Privacy Exposure Assessment** (60%): from the user's assessment answers (stored locally).
- **Digital Footprint Score** (40%): from the Service Exposure Indices of **services the user has selected/tracked**.

Relevant data sources:

| Data | Description | Where used / stored |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| **User assessment answers & results** | Answers and computed assessment score (0–100). | Local storage (e.g. `socialcaution_results`, assessment state); used for the 60% component. |
| **User's selected/tracked services** | List of service IDs the user has added to "My Services" or equivalent. | Local storage (e.g. `socialcaution_services`); used to compute the 40% Digital Footprint (average of Service Exposure Indices for those services). |
| **Service Exposure Index (per service)** | As above, from the three primary sources. | Calculated by `privacyExposureIndex.js` for each tracked service. |

So the **methodology's data sources** for the index are: (1) the three primary sources in Section 1, and (2) user inputs (assessment + selected services) for the combined score.

---

## 3. External / Upstream Sources (What We Curate From)

Service catalog and risk profiles are **not** live feeds; they are **curated** and updated from the following types of **public** information:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Privacy policies** | Official privacy policies and terms of service of each provider. |
| **News and reports** | Publicly reported incidents, investigations, and privacy-related news. |
| **Data breach databases / reports** | Public breach databases and breach reports (e.g. known, publicly reported breaches). Used for "known breach history" only; absence of data does not mean no breaches have occurred. |
| **Regulatory filings and enforcement** | Public regulatory actions, consent decrees, and enforcement related to privacy. |
| **Established privacy frameworks** | Frameworks and principles used to structure assessments (see Section 4). |

(privacy policies, news reports, data breach databases), and methodology note in translations (publicly available information, privacy policies, regulatory filings, established frameworks).*

---

## 4. Regulatory & Framework References

Privacy assessments and factor design are aligned with the following **established privacy frameworks and regulations** (referred to in methodology and translations):

| Framework / regulation | Relevant aspect (examples) |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| **GDPR** | Art. 13 (transparency); EU data subject rights. |
| **CCPA** | § 1798.100 (right to know). |
| **CPRA** | California privacy rights (extension of CCPA). |
| **COPPA** | Children's privacy. |
| **PIPEDA** | Principle 4 (limiting collection). |
| **LGPD** | Art. 18 (data subject rights). |
| **HIPAA** | Privacy and security rules (health data). |
| **FERPA** | Student privacy. |
| **GLBA** | Financial privacy. |
| **VCDPA** | Virginia consumer data rights. |

These are used to structure risk categories, recommended actions, and regulatory oversight (Factor 4); they are **reference frameworks**, not "data feeds" in the sense of Section 1.
